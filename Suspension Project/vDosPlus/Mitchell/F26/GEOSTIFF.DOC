                              STIFFNESS COEFFICIENT

The Stiffness coefficient is crucial to understanding the roll of the tire
spring rate.  The stiffness coefficient is defined as the ratio of the
spring rate of the spring to the spring rate of the tire.  If the tire has
a spring rate of 1,000 lbs/in and the spring is rated at 500 lbs/in, then
the stiffness coefficient is 500/1000 = 0.50.

If the spring rate of the tire is infinite, i.e., a rigid body, then the
stiffness coefficient is 0.0 regardless of what spring is used.  This
corresponds to the assumption of the regular suspension geometry program.

The Motion Ratio Computation must be performed in order to properly use the
Stiffness coefficient.  The Motion Ratio relates the stiffness of the spring
to the actual wheel rate.  The program then uses this wheel rate to
determinre the growth or deflection of the tire.  The program iterates until
a solution is found satisfies the normal requirements as well as the proper
ratio of spring travel and tire growth/deflection.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

NOTE:  Tire growth/deflection is now measured as the change in static loaded
radius.  It formerly was based in a change in the diameter of the tire.  This
new definition corresponds to normal use.

The Stiffness coefficient can (currently) only be used in CAD mode.  The
Stiffness coefficient starts at 0.0.  The lower case 's' key increases the
stiffness coefficient; upper case 'S' decreases the Stiffness coefficient.
The END key can be used to change delta from 0.1 to 0.01, 0.001 or 1.0.
The Stiffness coefficient can be manipulated just like ride heigth, body
roll, or any other variable.
