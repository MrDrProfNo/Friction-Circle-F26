                                SCRUB

SCRUB refers to the horizontal movement of the tire contact patch.
Positive scrub represents an outward movement of the contact patch,
generating a wider track.  Negative scrub represents the inward movement
of the tire contact patch.

Scrub as a function of body roll also depends upon the center of
rotation, which is the centerline of the vehicle at ground level in this
program.  This assumption will cause positive scrub on the loaded wheel
and negative scrub on the unloaded wheel as a result of positive body
roll.  This may or may not represent the actual movement of the vehicle.
Net Scrub may be a more realistic indicator.

The tire contact patch used in this program corresponds to the
centerline of the tire.  This is reasonable for a very thin tire, but
modern racing tires are not thin.  The center of pressure of the tire
should be used for the contact point, but this is a very complex
subject.
