You have used the cursor keys to change the suspension points you
entered (with their X-Y-Z co-ordinates) in the full screen editor
If you wish to SAVE the suspension you have in the computer now,
you must take action now.  To save the points in a file for future
use, answer YES to this question.

The original points you began with have been saved, but any changes
made with the cursor keys must now be saved or they will be lost.
