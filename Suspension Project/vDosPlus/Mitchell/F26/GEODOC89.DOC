                     SUSPENSION GEOMETRY FORCE ANALYSIS

The Suspension Geometry Force Analysis program augments the kinematic
analysis of the Geometry program with a computation of forces.  The program
determines the forces on various suspension elements as a result of forces
applied at the tire contact patch.  This can be used for stress analysis or
for an analysis of vehicle dynamics.

The Force Analysis program uses the same input files as the Freebody
Geometry program.  The user then specifies the force applied at the tire
contact patch in any direction (vertical load, acceleration/braking or
cornering) and the program computes the forces on the hub, the upper and
lower A-Arms, and the spring/shock system.  This information is displayed
in numerical form as well in graphical plots.

Additional analysis includes Jacking force and Dive/Squat analysis.  These
theoretical concerns are compared with actual computations.

The program also analyzes the location of the steering arm.  If the steering
arm is not aimed at the three-dimensional Instant Center axis then some of
the Jacking Force and Dive/Squat force will be fed off into the steering arm
and there will be significant bump steer.

The steering arm is usually aimed at the front view Instant Center to
minimize toesteer as a function of ride and roll changes.  But the steering
arm should be actually be aimed at the axis which runs from the front view
instant center to the side view instant center.  The suspension moves about
this axis.

The length of the steering arm also effects bump steer but as a second order
effect.
