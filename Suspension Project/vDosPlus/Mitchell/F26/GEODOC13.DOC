                                STEER

STEER refers to the steering movement of the wheels.  For the front
of the vehicle, it may result from both movement of the steering rack
and kinematic movement of the wheel due to suspension movement.  At the
rear STEER is simply the result of kinematics.

Positive STEER corresponds to the movement of both right and left
wheels in a LEFT turn.  Thus the right or loaded wheel turns inward and
the left or unloaded wheel turns outward.  Both of these are measured
in degrees and both are measured in positive amounts.  Negative STEER
would correspond to a RIGHT turn.

Positive steer in the right wheel is Toe-In, negative steer is
Toe-Out.  On the left or unloaded wheel the conventions are reversed;
Positive steer is Toe-Out, negative amounts are Toe-In.

Net Steer is the difference between Loaded and Unloaded Steer.
A positive Net Steer represents the right or loaded wheel turning left
more than the left or unloaded wheel.  Proper Ackerman values, wherein
the outboard wheel turns less than the inboard wheel, requires TOE-OUT
or negative Net Steer.  Computing actual Ackerman steering effects
requires knowledge of the radius of the turn.
