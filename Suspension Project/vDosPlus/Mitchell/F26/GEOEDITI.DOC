            Edit Data:  Iteration Limits and Co-Ordinate Origin

This screen includes two un-associated types of data.  The first is the
origin of YOUR co-ordinate system.  Many manufacturers use a co-ordinate
system which differs from the system used by the Suspension Geometry
program.  Many use a fixed point at the bottom of a bulkhead.  You may
enter suspension points in your co-ordinate system by FIRST defining the
origin of your co-ordinate system in this screen.

Specify where the RbyN origin is in your system.  The RbyN origin is at:
   X = Fore-Aft:  Centerline of wheel or tire contact patch
   Y = Cross-car: Centerline of chassis
   Z = Vertical:  Ground level

Let us suppose that the origin of your system is the bottom of a bulkhead
which is two inches off the ground and six inches in front of the tire
centerline.  You would enter the Coordinate system origin as:
             6.000   0.000  -2.000

Coordinate system origin           __0.000   __0.000   __0.000
This is the location of the RbyN co-ordinate system in YOUR co-ordinate
system.  If your co-ordinate system has the vertical origin (zero) on a
bulkhead two inches above the ground, enter -2.000 for Vertical above.
=========================================================================

Please note that you can not change the direction of positive values,
which remain:
   X = Fore-Aft:  Positive is towards the rear of the car
   Y = Cross-car: Positive is the distance from the Center-line
                 (when entering Asymmetric suspensions, both sides
                  are entered as positive: negative numbers would
                  only be used for special cases, like solid rear-
                  axle suspensions.)
   Z = Vertical:  Positive is Up.

                     Iterative Ranges and Increments

Ride height parameters:      _6 steps by __1.000 up and down from __0.000
Chassis Roll parameters:     _6 steps by __0.500 increasing from  __0.000

This calls for  182 iterations taking about  15.2 minutes.

If you are in Iterative Mode then this screen will appear.  The screen
shows the iteration variable (selected under the CAD/Iterate sub-menu)
and permits the user to select the number of steps to be included in the
iterative computation.  The user also selects the size of each step and
the initial position.  All iterative variables will be  treated as
'up and down' except for roll angle, which only increases.

Many aerodynamic cars are only interested in negative ride heights, i.e.,
the car will never be higher than it is in the pits.  Aerodynamic pressure
will force the car down with speed.  For this case you might use 8 steps
by 0.250 inches from an initial position of -2.000.  This cover the range
from -4.0 up to 0.0 by increments of 0.250.

The time estimate is an approximation for 8088 PCs.  Most newer computers
will run faster.  Use this as a rough indicator only.  You may be able to
develop your own scale factor, i.e., an estimate of 20 minutes may take
4 minutes on your computer.
