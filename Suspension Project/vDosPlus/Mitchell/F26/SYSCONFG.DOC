     The Program Options menu is a simple method of answering a series of
Yes/No questions which determine the program options.  Use the UP and DOWN
arrows to select a question (<DATA Source> in the example above), and then
use the LEFT or RIGHT arrows to pick the desired option.  The DATA source
option selected above is <Directory>.  This means the program will show
you the Directory of data files and allow you to select a file to read.
The alternative is to bypass the Directory and read the AADEMO file.

     The real advantage to the Program Options menu is that the next time
you start the program it will appear with the same options you selected on
the last run.  You do not have to specify the Video Monitor you are using
or your Unit of Length every time you run the program.  But you may change
choices when necessary.  This feature customizes the program for your use.
