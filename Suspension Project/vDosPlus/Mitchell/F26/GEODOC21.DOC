                                HALFSHAFT PLUNGE

Halfshaft plunge measures the movement of CV Joints necessary to bridge
the distance between rear end and hub.  Positive values represent
extension while negative values are compression.

The report also displays the angles of the CV Joints at both the rear
end and the hub.  However, the angles displayed are only two-dimensional.
The angle is measured in a vertical plane, as shown in the following
plot.  Any angle in the fore-aft plane is not computed.  This may be
changed in the future.
