The Edit Data choice allows you to edit the suspension point data in
the normal manner.  The No Edit option allows you to bypass the
editing step and proceed directly to computations.  This is useful
when reviewing a standard suspension or making a presentation.
However, the option is fraught with danger if the file does not
contain what you expect it to.
