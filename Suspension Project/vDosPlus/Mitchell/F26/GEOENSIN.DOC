This is the full screen editor to enter suspension co-ordinates, in the
Single Pass mode.  The X-Y-Z co-ordinates of all suspension points as
well as steering links must be entered.  These points must be measured
very carefully in order to produce accurate results.  Errors as small as
a quarter of an inch can destroy the accuracy of the results.

The bottom of the screen specifies lower A-Arm parameters.  These numbers
are the computational parameters.  They control the range of suspension
travel and the computation time.  The standard of 25 iterations with a
0.25 inch increment represents 12 iterations in bump for a total bump
travel of 3.00 inches as well as 12 jounce iterations for 3.00 inches of
jounce travel.

There is also a run-time estimate which gives the user an idea how long the
computations will take (i.e., watch the screen, go for coffee, or go to
lunch).  The estimates are for PC machines without a math co-processor.
Computers with a math co-processor (8087, 80287 or 80387 chip) or faster
internal speeds (XT, 286 or 386 machines will run faster.

Leave the Rack Travel parameters at ZERO.  This feature is still under
development.
