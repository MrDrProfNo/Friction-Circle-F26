There are several ways available to Edit and examine the data.

Iteration limits : Specify the iteration limits and the origin of your
                   co-ordinate system, if different from the program.

Description : Describe the data with your own free-form notes.  This
              helps you keep track of your data files.
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Graphic editing : Move suspension points on the screen using the cursor
                  control keys.

Analysis of points : This report shows various suspension lengths, the
                     location of Instant Centers, the length of the
                     Virtual Swing Arm, and a table of estimated
                     Ride-Camber and Roll-Camber values based upon the
                     length of the virtual swing arm.

Vehicle movement :  Allows you to perform certain operations on the
                    data, such as installing larger wheels and tires.

Suspension points : Enter the basic suspension points in a full-screen
                    editor.  This includes A-arms and tie-rod.

Auxiliary points : Enter the auxiliary suspension points including the
                   spring/shock, swaybar and halfshaft.

Left suspension : If you are doing an asymmetric suspension, these are
                  the left side points

Left auxiliary : Auxiliary points on the left side for asymmetric cases.
