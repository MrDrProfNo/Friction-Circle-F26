                        Edit Data: Suspension Points

These are the X-Y-Z co-ordinates of the suspension points.  Measure and
enter the points very carefully, or the results of your computations
will be useless.

The screen will also Check Values which should be used to verify your
measurements.  When you measure the car, measure the check values as
well as the location of the points.  If the computed Check Values don't
agree with your measurements, go back and re-measure.
