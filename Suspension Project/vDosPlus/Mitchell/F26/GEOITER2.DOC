                         Second Iteration Variable

                         +----------------------+
                         |  1 -  Not Available  |
                         |  2 - <Roll Angle   > |
                         |  3 -  Steer Angle    |
                         |  4 -  Tire Growth    |
                         |  5 -  None           |
                         +----------------------+

After selecting the first iteration variable, choose the second variable.
This may not be the same as the first (see the Not Available above, since
we selected Ride Height for the first iteration variable.

For a Full Ride and Roll computation, select Roll Angle as the second
iteration variable.  If you only want a Ride Height computation, then
select None as the second iteration variable.
