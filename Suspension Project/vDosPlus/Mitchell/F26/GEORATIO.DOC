The relationship between wheel travel and shock travel can be expressed in
two different ways, called the Motion Ratio and the Velocity Ratio.

The Motion Ratio, which is the default, is Shock Travel / Wheel Travel.

The Velocity Ratio is Wheel Travel/Shock Travel = 1 / Motion Ratio.

Select the ratio you are most comfortable with.  Both ratios are shown in
the Tutorial.
