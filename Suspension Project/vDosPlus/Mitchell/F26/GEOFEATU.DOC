The Full-Featured option draws a more realistic race car as part of
the graphics presentation.  This option may make it easier to picture
the suspension points and their operation.

The Full-Featured Model can be particularily helpful while entering
the initial suspension points.  This feature permits you do enter
the X-Y-Z co-ordinates of a point and then look at a drawing of the
suspension from a variety of perspectives.

You may choose to show either a formula car or a sedan, with either
left hand drive or right hand drive.  Drawing this Full-Featured option
requires additional computer time.  Try it and see if you like it.
