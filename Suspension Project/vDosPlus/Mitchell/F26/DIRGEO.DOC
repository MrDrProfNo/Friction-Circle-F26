These are files of suspension points.  Each file contains the suspension
points and computational parameters for a specific vehicle.  Saving files
avoids the necessity to re-enter points for each run.

Each suspension file also includes a one-line description, which can be
seen by Previewing the files with the F3 function key.  The files also
also contail a five line detailed description, which can only be seen
after reading the file.

Even if you are entering data for a new vehicle, you must start with
existing data.  The AADEMO file may be a good starting point.  Using
existing data helps get the proper signs and values into the computer.

Be sure to the the DEMO file appropriate to the type of suspension you
are studying.  Reading a solid rear-axle suspension DEMO file, such as
PAN3DEMO involves different suspension points than a MacPherson Strut
(MACDEMO) or a Double A-arm suspension (AADEMO).
