                    RESPONDING TO A REAL NUMBER PROMPT

The program is asking for a REAL number.  Enter the number in the
high-lighted area.  You may use a decimal point and a minus sign.
If you do not use a decimal point, one will be inserted after the
number you enter.  Do not use parentheses, i.e. (123.45), for negative
amounts. Use the minus sign for negative numbers, i.e. -123.45.

If you want the originally displayed value, press Enter at the beginning.

Press Enter after entering the value.

Press the F2 key for a description of what number the program expects
  (details on units, etc.)
