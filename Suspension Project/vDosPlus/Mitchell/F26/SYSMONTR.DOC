This menu allows you to specify the graphics monitor on your computer.
After selecting a graphics board (items 1 .. A above), another menu will
appear which allows you to specify the graphics mode you want.  For
instance, the common CGA board has two 200 x 320 color modes and one
high resolution 200 x 640 monochrome mode.

Item B for DETECT will have the computer attempt to identify the graphics
board on your computer.  This selection should be verified by the process
described below.

Item C for CHECK allows you to check the validity of your selection.  The
computer will use your graphic selection and draw a test pattern on the
screen.  The test pattern consists of a series of boxes-within-boxes with
an X drawn through the corners.  If this test pattern does not appear in
it's entirity, particularily the bottom of the boxes, then make another
graphics selection and try again.

If several graphic selections work, choose the one which is most pleasing.

QUIT this menu when you have made and checked your graphics selection.

These are the MODE choices for EGA graphics.  If you are not familiar with
the various modes, use the CHECK option to select the most pleasing mode
for your graphics board.  The highest resolution is usually the best
because the Racing by the Numbers programs do not use all the colors
available with some graphics boards.
