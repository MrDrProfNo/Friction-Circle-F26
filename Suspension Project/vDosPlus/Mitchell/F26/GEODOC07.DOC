                 VIRTUAL SWING AXLE or INSTANT CENTER

The Instant Center is a conceptual point used for analysis of the
movement of suspension.  For small displacements, a suspension moves
as if there were a swing axle located at the Instant Center.  This
imaginary link is known as a Virtual Swing Axle.  This is a useful
analysis tool, though the Instant Center moves as soon as the
suspension does, thus creating another Virtual Swing Axle.

To determine the Instant Center, first imagine a vertical plane which
passes through the contact patches of both wheels.  Now imagine a plane
encompassing the upper control arms.  The intersection of these planes
is a line known as the virtual upper control arm.  (In many cases the
forward control link is in the horizontal plane, and is also the virtual
control arm).  Repeat for the lower control arms.  Then project those
control links to infinity.  The intersection of these projected lines
is the Instant Center.
