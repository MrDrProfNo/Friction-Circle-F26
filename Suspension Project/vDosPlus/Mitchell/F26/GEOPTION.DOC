There are several suspension options available for the various structures.
You may decide whether or not to include various suspension elements in
your computations, including Spring/Shock, Swaybar, Halfshaft and
Push/Pull rod.  Do not Use Halfshafts unless the suspension has them.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

Some structures do not support Swaybar or Push/Pull rods.  If the choice
does not appear in this menu, then the structure does not support the
element.  To do Push/Pull rods you must have Suspension_Type=4 or 5.

An important choice is whether or not to do the Motion Ratio computations.
Selecting this option will double the computation time because the
suspension is lowered 0.01 inch for a base computation, and then raised
to desired height and computed again.  This gives you a very accurate
Motion Ratio value (or Veleocity Ratio, if you prefer) but takes time.

You may relocate some attachment points.  For instance, some formula cars
have a double A-arm rear suspension but with the 'steering tie-rod' (or
it's equivalent) attached to the lower A-arm rather than to the chassis.
You could also attach the spring or swaybar to different suspension rods.
