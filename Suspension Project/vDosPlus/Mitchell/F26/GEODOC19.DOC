                               MOTION RATIO

     Motion Ratio is the change in Shock Travel divided by the change in
Ride height.  If the ride height (or wheel) moves 4.0 inches and the
Shock Travel is 3.0 inches, then the Motion Ratio is 0.75.  The wheel
rate is the spring rate times the SQUARE of the Motion Ratio.

     Computing the Motion Ratio requires TWO suspension calculations.
The two computations must have the same Roll and Steer values.  The
Motion Ratio is computed as the difference in Shock Travel divided by
the difference in Ride Height for the two computations.  The difference
in Ride Height may be as small as 0.001 for an accurate Motion Ratio
computation.

     See the following Graphic for an example of the Motion Ratio
computation.

                   Shock Travel at Ride=1.01 is 0.89234
                   Shock Travel at Ride=1.00 is 0.88642
                   The difference is            0.00592
                   The Motion Ratio is 0.00592/0.01 = 0.592

     A 100 lb/inch spring would have a Wheel Rate of 100 * 0.592 * 0.592
                                                      = 35.0464 lb/inch.
