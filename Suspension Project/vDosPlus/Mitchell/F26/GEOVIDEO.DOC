                              SELECT MONITOR

This option allows you to specify the graphics adaptor and video
monitor you wish to use.  After selecting the monitor you can
specify a mode, which precisely defines both the text and graphics
output, including the resolution and the colors.

The DETECT option will allow the software to select the monitor.

The VERIFY option will display a series of boxes within boxes to
verify your graphics selection.  If you don't see all the boxes
on the screen, try another graphics mode.

WARNING:  If you attempt to select a monitor combination you do
not have, your computer may lock up.  You may be able to get out
of this by hitting any key, or with the CTRL-Break, but you may
have to re-boot your computer with the CTRL-ALT-DEL combination.

The QUIT option picks the last choice you made and leaves the menu.
