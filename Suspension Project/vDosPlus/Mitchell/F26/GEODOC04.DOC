                            STEERING INPUT

The Steering Input is expressed as a fraction of the nominal steering
rack travel.  The nominal steering rack travel is the usable amount,
not the maximum physically available.  The nominal steering rack
travel should represent what is likely to be used on the race track,
not what is available when pushing the car about the pits.  Indeed,
the nominal steering rack travel might even be different for a CART
car set up for Indy than for the same car at Long Beach.

The steering input is expressed as a fraction of the nominal steering
rack travel.  Thus a steering input of "0.5" represents 50% of the
nominal steering rack travel.  A POSITIVE input corresponds to a LEFT
hand turn.  This applies for both front-steer and rear-steer geometries.
input of "0.5" represents 50% of the steering rack travel in the
direction corresponding to a left hand turn.  (This is correct for
both front-steer and rear-steer geometries.)  A NEGATIVE steering input
corresponds to a RIGHT turn.

The steering input may be greater than "1.0".  For instance, a value of
"1.5" represents 150% of the nominal steering rack travel.  No check is
made that the steering rack travel is actually obtainable.
