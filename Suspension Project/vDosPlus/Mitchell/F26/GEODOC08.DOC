                              ROLL CENTER

If each suspension rotates about the Instant Center, then the entire
chassis rotates about the Roll Center.  This imaginary point lies in
the same plane as the Instant Centers and the Virtual Swing Axles.

To determine the Roll Center, construct lines from the Instant Centers
to the Contact patches.  The Roll Center is located at the intersection
of these lines.

If both Instant Centers are above ground and on the opposite side as
their wheel, then the Roll Center will be above ground and between the
wheels.  If one Instant Center is below ground and the other above, then
the Roll Center will be outside the wheels.  If both Instant Centers are
below ground, then the Roll Center will also be below ground.

A high roll center usually means more jacking force which tends to raise
the chassis (like short swing axle cars), but a high roll center
minimizes body roll.  A low roll center, even below ground, minimizes
the jacking effect but creates more body roll.
