Execute will cause the program to leave the Data Input & Editing portion
of the program, read the appropriate suspension structure information,
and begin processing data.

Read data will display the Directory of files and allow the user to read
another data file.

Save data will save the current data.  It is not necessary to do this
because the files are automatically saved when you Execute.

Go will restart the program with the Program Options menu.

Quit will terminate the program.
