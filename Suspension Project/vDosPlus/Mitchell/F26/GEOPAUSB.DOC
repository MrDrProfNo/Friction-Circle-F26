The Pause after Plot option is used in the Full Ride and Roll option to
pause after the graphics display of roll values before the screen is
cleared to show a table of values.  This allows you to study the screen
or to do a PrintScreen.

WARNING:  This option requires you to press a key to leave the final
graphics display.  However, the computer delays responding to this
command to insure that all PrtSc are complete.  To not be impatient
and hit additional keys until the tables appear.
