                             KINGPIN AXIS

The Kingpin Axis is a line drawn through the Upper and Lower ball
joints, as viewed from the front.  A positive kingpin axis is inclined
toward the tire at ground level.  The lower ball joint is closer to the
tire than the upper ball joint when the kingpin axis is positive.

Most vehicles have a positive kingpin axis in order to provide a
centering effect in steering.  With a positive kingpin axis the chassis
is at it's lowest when the steering is straight forward.  Thus the
chassis seeks to return to zero steer after steering movements.

The kingpin axis is usually determined by the hub or upright used.
But static camber changes made by changing the length of suspension
links will also change the kingpin inclination.
