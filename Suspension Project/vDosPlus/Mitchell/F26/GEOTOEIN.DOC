Toe steer can be measured in either <degrees> (the default) or inches
(or centimeters in the metric case).  When inches is selected, the
program assumes you have placed a 28-inch long board flush against the
wheel.  Then toe steer is measured as the difference between the front
of the board and the centerline of the car and the rear of the board
and the centerline of the car.  Alignment wheels do the same thing.

The 28-inch base measurement can be changed in the #1 editing
selection.  The 28-inch reference is used by one oval track team.
Other teams may use an alignment wheel or board of some other
reference length.  The measured toesteer is the difference between the
two ends of the board, not just the movement of one end of the board.
The relation is Toesteer(inches) = Span * Tangent (Toesteer in degrees)
