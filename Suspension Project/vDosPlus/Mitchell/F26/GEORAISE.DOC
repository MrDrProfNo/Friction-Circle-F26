This option permits you to change the tire diameter and change all
suspension points an appropriate amount.  For instance, if you have
entered data for a 24.0 inch diameter tire and wish to see what will
happen with a 26.0 inch tire.  This option will change the tire diameter
from 24.0 to 26.0 and will raise the height of all suspension points by
1.0 inches.

This option merely saves a lot of editing of suspension points.

Note that this is NOT the same as changing the co-ordinate system.  This
actually changes the location of suspension points.  A change of
co-ordinate system merely prints numbers which agree with your other
drawings.
