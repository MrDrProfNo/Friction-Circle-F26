                        |    Read, Edit or Save  |
                        |                        |
                        |    R -  READ a file    |
                        |    E - <EDIT the data> |
                        |    S -  SAVE a file    |
                        +------------------------+

          Enter choice (R/E/S) or use arrow keys and hit <ENTER>

This is a Menu of available program actions.  Select one action by
hitting the key corresponding to the character (either number or letter)
shows to the left of the action.

This menu is also a bounce-bar menu.  One entry is high-lighted and
enclosed in brackets - <EDIT the data> above.  The high-lighted entry
may be changed with the UP ARROW and DOWN ARROW keys.  When the desired
entry is highlighted, hit ENTER to select the entry.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

These menus operate in wrap-around fashion. If the top entry is highlighted
and you hit the UP ARROW, the highlight will move to the bottom entry.
If the bottom entry is highlighted and you hit the DOWN ARROW, then the
highlight will move to the top entry. This is useful in moving to the
bottom entry, which is often QUIT.
