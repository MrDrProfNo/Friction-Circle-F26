This is the full screen editor to enter suspension co-ordinates, in the
Full Ride & Roll mode.  The X-Y-Z co-ordinates of all suspension points as
well as steering links must be entered.  These points must be measured
very carefully in order to produce accurate results.  Errors as small as
a quarter of an inch can destroy the accuracy of the results.

The bottom of the screen specifies Ride height and Chassis Roll parameters.
These are the computational parameters.  They control the range of
suspension travel and the computation time.  The standard of 6 iterations
0.50 inch Ride height represents 6 iterations in bump for a total bump
travel of 3.00 inches as well as 6 jounce iterations for 3.00 inches of
jounce travel.  Six roll iterations of 0.50 degrees will cover 3.0 degrees
of chassis roll.  Production vehicles may roll much more.

There is also a run-time estimate which gives the user an idea how long the
computations will take (i.e., watch the screen, go for coffee, or go to
lunch).  The estimates are for PC machines without a math co-processor.
Computers with a math co-processor (8087, 80287 or 80387 chip) or faster
internal speeds (XT, 286 or 386 machines will run faster.
