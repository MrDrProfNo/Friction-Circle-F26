               OUTBOARD ANTI-DIVE, ANTI-LIFT and ANTI-SQUAT

     Outboard Anti analysis applies to situations where the braking or
acceleration force is applied at the contact patch, i.e. outboard brakes
front or rear or acceleration with a solid rear axle.

     The Anti Factor is calculated by dividing the height of the Side View
Instant Center by the distance of the Side View Instant Center from the
tire contact patch.

     Next you must find the pivot point for vertical movement of the car.
For Anti-Dive this is the wheelbase multiplied by the proportion of braking
effort on the front wheels.  For Anti-Lift it is the wheelbase multiplied
by the proportion of braking effort on the rear wheels, or one minus the
front proportion.  For acceleration (of a rear-wheel drive car) it is the
wheelbase. For front-wheel drive you would calculate Anti-Rise at the front
using the full wheelbase.  For four-wheel drive you would apportion the
acceleration between front and rear just as you do for braking.

     Now compute the Height of the Center of Gravity divided by the
longitudinal reference distance (see the paragraph above).  Then the Anti
Factor is divided by this fraction to get the Anti Percentage.
