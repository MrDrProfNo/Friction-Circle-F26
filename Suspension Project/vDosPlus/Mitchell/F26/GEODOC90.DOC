This is a proprietary method for determining the length of the Upper A-Arm
which will provide minimal lateral roll center movement as the vehicle
rolls.  This procedure must be called with RIDE=0.0, STEER=0.0 and with a
small, but not zero, value of ROLL (0.1 is a good value.)  When this is
done the procedure will compute the desired length for the Upper A-Arm.
This value can then be entered in the Dynamic Editing section.

>  For the above example, an Upper A-Arm length of 10.110 gave the
following results:

                    ROLL      LATERAL ROLL CENTER LOCATION
                    1.00              -0.009
                    2.00               0.012
                    3.00               0.088
                    4.00               0.244

Even greater accuracy can be obtained by performing the computation again.
