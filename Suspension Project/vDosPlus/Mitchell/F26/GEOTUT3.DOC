These tutorials contain some additional tabular information.
----------------------------------------------------------------------

1.  The Suspension Analysis gives lengths of the suspension links, and
    other basic data.

2.  Kinematics vs. Force explains two fundamental issues.

3.  Display Parameters shows the suspension elements in tabular form.

4.  Display Points gives the location of suspension points to high
    accuracy.  This can be used as input to other programs.

5.  Change graphic scale controls the appearance of the tutorials.
    This permits the user to see a wider image or to narrow in on a
    specific area.
----------------------------------------------------------------------
6.  The Solution Summary describes the mathematical solution of the
    suspension problem.  This is mainly for debugging.

7.  The Fundamental Analysis gives Roll Camber, Ride Camber, and other
    calculated variables based on virtual swing arm length.

8.  The Rotation Analysis is for debugging.

9.  The Force Computations calculate the forces on suspension points
    resulting from input forces at the tire contact patch

0.  The Roll Center Analysis is a mathematical procedure to determine
    the length of the Upper A-Arm to give a roll center which does not
    move laterally as the vehicle rolls.
