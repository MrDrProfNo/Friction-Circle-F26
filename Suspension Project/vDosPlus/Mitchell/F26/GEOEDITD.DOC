                         Edit Data: The Description

This screen includes two descriptions of the suspension data.  The first
description, near the top of the screen, is a one line entry which will
appear at the bottom of the graphic screen, and will be shown when you
Preview files before reading.  This description is limited to 40
characters.

The other description includes 5 79-character lines and permits much
greater detail.  A one line description of "90-X fr wt rr/mod 3 plus 2"
may be very meaningful when you create the file, but six months later
it will help to refer to the extended description and see that this
file is for the "Blast 90-X car, front suspension with the wide-track
road racing option, modification number 3 (low roll center with short
virtual swing arm and rapidly rising rate suspension using the +2 hole
in the bell-crank."

This screen also describes the Structure associated with the file, as
specified by the Suspension Type.  This material can not be changed,
but it may indicate a need to change the Suspension Type.
