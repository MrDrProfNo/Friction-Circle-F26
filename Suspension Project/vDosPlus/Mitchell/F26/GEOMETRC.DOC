If you select the METRIC option, then you may enter all suspension
coordinates in centimeters.  The standard choice is <inches>.

Actually, the Suspension Geometry is dimensionless.  The geometry is the
same whether you are dealing with a full size vehicle or a scale model.
All the METRIC option really does is change the scale of the graphics
plotted on the computer screen.  The scale of those plots is designed
for a vehicle with a 50-70 inch track.

One advantage of the METRIC option is converting inches to centimeters.
If you have data stored in inches, and you select the METRIC option, then
the program will convert the suspension points from inches to centimeters.
Or from centimeters to inches.
