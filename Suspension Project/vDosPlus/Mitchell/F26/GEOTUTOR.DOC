The tutorials offer detailed explanations of the suspension parameters.
The Primary tutorials are the front-view parameters, including camber,
scrub, instant center, roll center and kingpin.

The eXtra tutorials include the sideview parameters such as caster,
caster trail, sideview swing arm, and Anti-Dive/Anti-Squat/Anti-Lift.
It also includes the top view parameters of toe steer, net steer and
Ackerman analysis.  This section also includes motion ration or
velocity ratio, swaybar twist and halfshaft plunge and inclination.

The Other reports imclude a variety of special reports such as analysis
of suspension lengths, the X-Y-Z location of the suspension points, a
detailed analysis of the mathematical solution of the problem, and a
fundamental analysis of the suspension.  There is also a report which
gives the length of the Upper A-arm to produce a suspension which will
have a roll center which does not more horizontally due to body roll.
