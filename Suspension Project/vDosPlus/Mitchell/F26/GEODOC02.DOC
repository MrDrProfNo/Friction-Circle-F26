                            RIDE HEIGHT

ZERO ride height is the position of the vehicle when the suspension
points were measured, not the clearance between chassis and ground.
A POSITIVE ride height means the chassis is raised, either through a
mechanical adjustment or due to dynamic forces acting upon the vehicle.
A positive ride height represents DROOP or REBOUND of the suspension
and tire.  A NEGATIVE ride height represents lowering the chassis,
either through a mechanical adjustment or due to forces acting upon
the vehicle.  A negative ride height represents BUMP or PARALLEL JOUNCE.

No provision is made for either ground clearance or spring/shock travel.
You may move the vehicle as high or as low as you wish, even to
positions the actual car can not reach.

RIDE height is portrayed two ways on the screen.  The word RIDE
with the position (in inches) appears near the top of the screen.
A horizontal line off the roll angle portrays RIDE height.  There is
also a horizontal line in the chassis area showing the bottom of the
chassis at zero ride height.
