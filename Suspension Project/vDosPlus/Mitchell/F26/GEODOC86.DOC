<                        SOLUTION SUMMARY

This table shows the accuracy of computed solution.  It is useful to
verify the accuracy of a solution.

The first line shows the Tolerance of the computation, which is 0.00001
without a math co-processor and 0.000001 with a math co-processor.  The
assorted computed parameters should all have an error less than this
amount.

If the Summary ERROR is greater than the tolerance, then the bottom
line attempts to show which suspension component generated the problem.
If the problem is only with the Bar, then the Camber, Instant Center, etc.
are probably OK.  If the problem is with the Arm, then the problem is
more serious.  Failures to determine a solution are probably related to
a physical problem.  The suspension may not be capable of reaching a given
location.  For instance, as you raise the Ride Height, there comes a point
when the suspension arms are too short for the tire to reach the ground.

This display is intended for the use of the programmer.

The Solution Summary is used to verify the accuracy of the numerical
solution.
The "Distance" column represents the calculated distances of the structure.
The "Objective" column is what the calculated distances should be.
The "Error" column is the difference between Distance and Objective.
For a correct solution all of the Error values should be less than the
"Tolerance", which is 0.00001 for computers without 8087 math chips and
0.000001 for computers with math co-processors.

Solving for distances to one-millionth of an inch does not mean the camber
is correct to the same degree.  Because the Camber is computed as a
difference between points, an error of 0.000001 can produce a larger error.
But experimentation as shown that accuracy of 0.00001 gives camber accuracy
of 0.001, which should be sufficiently accurate for our needs.

- - - - - - - - - - - - - -  REPEATING SOLUTIONS  - - - - - - - - - - - - -

You may notice that re-calculating the same problem may result in a
slightly different solution.  You may re-compute the same points at the
same Ride, Roll and Steering position and get a different solution, as
shown in the error values above.  This is because the program learns from
it's past calculations and one calculation may follow a slightly different
path (and hopefully quicker) to a solution than the previous computation.
As long as both solutions are within the tolerance, this should may make
no significant difference.
