The QUICK 2-Dimension option causes the computer to perform all
calculations in two dimensions rather than three.  This may be useful
for preliminary calculations, but we live in a three dimensional world
and all serious analysis should be done in three dimensions.

You can not perform steering analysis in two dimensions.

However, the two dimension is much faster.  Two dimension calculations
require only about 20% of the computation time for three dimensions.
