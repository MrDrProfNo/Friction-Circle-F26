Program:    This menu allows you to configure the program to your own
Options     application.  You may specify your video monitor, the units
            you prefer to use (length in inches or metric, etc.), and
            whether you have a symmetric suspension (road racing) or
            asymmetric (oval track).  You may also specify if you want
            printed output, and even the amount of detail of the
            graphics which appear on the monitor.

            Each time you restart the program, this menu will appear
            with the choices you made for the last run.  You do not have
            to configure the program each time you run the program.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Data Input:  This Pull-down menu includes the data input, editing and
& Editing    suspension options.

             The first choice is for CAD or Iterative mode.  In CAD mode
             you manipulate the vehicle on the screen.  In Iterative mode
             the computer runs through a series of values and prepares
             tables of results, as well as files for the Display program.

             Suspension options specify the details of the suspension you
             are studying.  You may specify whether or not there is a
             swaybar or halfshafts.  You may specify whether or not you
             want to study spring/shock travel and whether or not you want
             to compute a motion or velocity ratio.

             The suspension options even allow you to define where the
             various elements of the suspension are attached.  For instance,
             the spring/shock may be attached to the lower A-arm while the
             swaybar is attached to the upper A-arm.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

             The Edit data choices allow you to enter the co-ordinates of
             the suspension points, describe the file, and even specify
             your co-ordinate system.

             Most of this editing is done with full-screen editors to
             enter numeric values.  The editors have check sums which
             verify the input data.

             Other options permit you to depict the suspension points on
             the screen and move the points with the cursor arrows.

             This selection also includes an analysis selection with more
             verification data including Instant Centers and the length of
             virtual swing arms.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Sketch:   This option produces a sketch of the suspension from various
vehicle   perspectives.  The sketch also labels the suspension points.
          This graphical sketch permits you to verify your data: if it
          doesn't look right, it isn't right.

          The sketch feature also permits you to specify a formula car
          or sedan for the graphic displays.  The sedan can be either
          left hand drive or right hand drive, for Europeans.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

eXecute:  After completing the data input, the computer begins to process
or quit   the data.  If you selected the Iterative mode, then the program
          will run through the range of ride, roll and steer values you
          selected.  After each series of iterations the computer will
          produce a set of tables.  These tables will also be printed if
          you specified printer output in the program options menu.

          If you selected the CAD menu, then you may manipulate the
          suspension geometry with the arrow keys (UP, DOWN, LEFT or
          RIGHT), the PG UP and PG DN keys (to control steering), and
          the INS and DEL keys to control tire growth/deflection.

          In CAD mode you may also use the ESCape key to bring up a
          pulldown menu for Dynamic Editing of suspension points.
          This permits you to move points graphically on the screen.

          The Tutorials permit detailed examination of each of the
          suspension parameters to see how they are determined and
          what they mean.

The Tutorial section has several special reports, including the following:

    Display an Analysis of the Suspension, including the lengths of links.
    Display Suspension Parameters  (in non-graphic format)
    Display Suspension Points  (numeric location of points)
    Change the Graphic Scale used for Tutorials
    Fundamental Analysis of suspension based upon the location
        of the Instant Center
    Roll Center Analysis - compute true upper A-Arm length to
        produce roll center which will remain stationary as the
        chassis rolls.

    You can also examine the mathematical solution of the problem to see
    if any suspension elements are binding or preventing a solution.
