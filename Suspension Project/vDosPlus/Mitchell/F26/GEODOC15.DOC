                          SIDE VIEW SWING ARM

     The Side View Swing Arm is used to understand the vertical motion
of the vehicle in reaction to braking and acceleration. The braking
reaction is called Anti-Dive at the front and Anti-Lift at the rear.
Under braking the tends to dive at the front and lift at the rear. This
tendency can be resisted by building "Anti-Dive" and "Anti-Lift" into
the suspension geometry.

     Under acceleration the rear of the vehicle tends to squat (assuming
the vehicle is rear-wheel drive). This tendency can be resisted by
building "Anti-Squat" into the suspension.

     This analysis begins with a Virtual Swing Arm which is located at
an Instant Center, just like the Front View Virtual Swing Arm and Instant
Center.  But look at the suspension geometry rather than the front view.
The Instant Center is determined in two steps. The first, which is often
overlooked, involves projecting the upper and lower control arms into the
plane of the tire.  Then those points are projected forward or backward to
a side view instant center.  The Side View Virtual Swing Arm is assumed to
be mounted at this instant center.  For small movement, the suspension can
be analyzed as if it were a swing arm mounted in this manner.
