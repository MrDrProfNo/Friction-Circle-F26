These options control the appearance of the stick-model drawing of the
suspension structure.  This drawing can label each suspension point and
even draw different suspension elements in a different color.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
You may specify both the perspective angle and the elevation angle,
giving you complete control of viewing location.  (You can even look at
the car from underneath).  You may specify whether you view the entire
car or just one side.  You can even control the center of the view and
the scale for an up-close examination of a portion of the suspension,
such as a bell-crank pivot.
