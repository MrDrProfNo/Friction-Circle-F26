                             FUNDAMENTAL ANALYSIS

This analysis of instantaneous parameters is based on an analysis of the
instant center.  This analysis describes the movement of the tire over small
movements.  It may be compared with computed values in Display Parameters.
The Loaded side has an Instant Center at       86.561 horizontal
                                     and        0.446 height

    The instantaneous Ride Camber is            0.662 degrees/inch
                      Roll Camber is            0.620 degrees/degree
                      Ride Scrub is            -0.005 inches/inch

The Unloaded side has an Instant Center at    121.808 horizontal
                                       and      3.119 height

    The instantaneous Ride Camber is            0.470 degrees/inch
                      Roll Camber is            0.730 degrees/degree
                      Ride Scrub is            -0.026 inches/inch
    The instantaneous Ride Net Scrub is        -0.031 inches/inch

<                          FUNDAMENTAL ANALYSIS

The Instant Center of the suspension provides a means of computing the
theoretical Ride Camber, Roll Camber and Ride Scrub.  Those values are
shown in this report.

The Theoretical formulas are:

    Ride Camber = 57.296 * ArcTan(1.0/Swing Arm length)
                = 57.296 /Swing Arm Length.  (approximation)

    In the above example, swing arm length=86.664 gives Ride Camber=0.661.

    Roll Camber = 1.0 - (track/2.0)/Swing arm length
                = 0.620 in the above example

    Ride Scrub  = Swing Arm Height / Swing Arm Length
                = 0.425/86.664  = 0.005
    Ride Scrub  = 3.120/121.802 = 0.028
    Ride Net    =                 0.033  vs. 0.027 actual

Computed suspension parameters:

     Track of 32.80     Ride Camber =       1.747 * (1.0 - Roll Camber)
     One degree of Roll is                   0.573 inches of spring travel

     Loaded side Virtual Swing Arm length   =  118.008
     Instantaneous Ride Camber is                0.486 degrees per inch
     Instantaneous Roll Camber is                0.722 degrees per degree


     Unloaded side Virtual Swing Arm length =  192.851
     Instantaneous Ride Camber is                0.297 degrees per inch
     Instantaneous Roll Camber is               -0.829 degrees per degree
