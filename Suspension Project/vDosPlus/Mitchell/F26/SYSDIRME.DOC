This sample directory includes all the files with the extension .XYZ.
These files represent the 1987 Indy car schedule.  All file names
are limited to 8 characters, thus "CLEVELAN" for Cleveland and
"LONGBEAC" for Long Beach.  Blanks are NOT permitted, thus "LONGBEAC"
for Long Beach.  The AADEMO file is used for the Tutorial.  The
Drive B: and Drive C: entries allow the user to look at the directory
on those files.  Do not use Drive C: unless you have a C drive, and
only the active subdirectory can be accessed.

<                        DATA FILE DIRECTORY MENU

This Directory menu contains the names of appropriate data files.
One filename is high-lighted and enclosed in < filename >.  Use the
UP ARROW and DOWN ARROW keys (or LEFT ARROW and RIGHT ARROW) if there
is more than one column of filenames) to highlight the filename you
want.  Then press ENTER to read the desired file.

ESCape will allow you to leave the Directory menu without reading a file.
However, some programs will insist that you read a file.  Use the F2
function key for additional information on the specific files.

You may Preview files by pressing the F3 function key.  This will display
a description of each file.  Use F4 to change text colors.

The Directory only lists files on one disk drive, as desiginated in the
first line.  You may examine and select files on another disk drive by
bouncing to the "Drive X" line and hitting ENTER.  Then a new Directory
menu will appear and you may examine and select a file, or change drives
again.  You may NOT access data in a different subdirectory.

Use the F3 key to produce a Preview of the appropriate Directory listings.
The Preview consists of the File Names alongwith the Description of the
contents.  This is very helpful when you are dealing with a large number
of files and can't remember exactly what "MOD3-X1" meant when you created
the file three months ago.  This a Preview of Suspension Geometry files:

Your DOS manual will define permitted file names.  Generally, you may use
the 26 letters, 10 digits, and certain special characters (- _ $ # & @ !).
Lowercase characters are converted to upper case. Blanks are NOT permitted
and periods (.) or slashes (\ /) have special meaning. Filenames may be up
to 8 characters in length. RACING BY THE NUMBERS (tm) assigns extensions;
you enter MID-OHIO and the program will save MID-OHIO.XYZ.

You should not use filenames beginning with AA or A and any special
characters, i.e. AAA, A, A# or A$. These filenames, or any others which
precede AADEMO, may cause the Demos to fail to run properly. You may use
these filenames on a data disk because the Demos only use files on the
program disks.

This restriction also applies to filename beginning with numbers, like
911. If you have a filename for a Porsche, use a filename like POR911 or
ever P911. If you use a filename like 911 then the DEMOs may not run.
