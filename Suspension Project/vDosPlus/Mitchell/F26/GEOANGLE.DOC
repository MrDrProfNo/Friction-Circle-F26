The viewing angle changes your perspective of the car.  The default
viewing angle of 0.0 corresponds to ground level.  A 90 degree angle
represents a plan view, or viewing the car from above.  A 20-40 degree
viewing angle represents our normal view of the car.

At the default viewing angle of 0.0 the wishbones may appear as a single
rod.  By selecting a greater viewing angle both arms of the wishbone
come into view.  Select the viewing angle which provides the most
informative or familiar view.
