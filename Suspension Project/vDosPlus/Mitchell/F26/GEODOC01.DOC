                        GRAPHICAL PERSPECTIVE

The screen display of the suspension depicts the view from the rear of
the vehicle looking forward.  This is the driver's view of the front
suspension.

The graphic shows part of the tub, the upper and lower control arms,
the hub or upright, and the centerline of the tire.

The vehicle is making a LEFT turn (unless negative values of ROLL and
STEER are used).  The right side of the screen shows the right side
suspension, which is also referred to as the outboard side or LOADED
side.  The left side of the screen shows the left side suspension,
which is also referred to as inboard or UNLOADED side.
