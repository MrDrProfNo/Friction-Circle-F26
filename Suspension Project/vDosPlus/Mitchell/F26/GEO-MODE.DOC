The Suspension Geometry Program runs in two modes.  You must select one
mode at the beginning of each run, and you can not change during a run.

The CAD mode is for preliminary analysis or for studying a specific
condition.  The suspension may be manipulated from the keyboard.  The user
may control ride height, roll, and steering inputs and see the effect on
the screen.  The user may also move the suspension points, but no files
are saved from these computations; the user must record the results.

The ITERATIVE (formerly Full Ride & Roll) modes run the suspension through
a series of pre-determined conditions to generate tables and plots of
suspension behavior.  The user sets the limits of suspension movement.
The resulting tables may be examined on the screen or printed.  Data files
are also created which may be examined with the DISPLAY program.

Both of these modes accompolish the same objective, but the Iterative mode
is much more thorough and complete (and much more time-consuming).  It may
require an hour of computer time to run a thorough Iterative case, but no
operater intervention is required - let the computer run over lunch.
