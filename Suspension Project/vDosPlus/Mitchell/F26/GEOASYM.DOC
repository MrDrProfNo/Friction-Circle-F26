An asymmetric suspension uses different suspension mounting points on the
left and right sides of a car.  This is normally seen only on oval track
cars.  Most road racing cars use the same suspension mounting points on
both sides of the car.  Of course, they are really mirror images, so the
suspension points may be the similiar but the suspension parts are not
interchangeable.

If you select the ASYMMETRIC suspension option, then you must enter the
suspension points for both sides of the car.

If you do not select the ASYMMETRIC suspension option, then you only enter
one set of suspension points and the program applies them to both sides of
the vehicle.

Many solid rear axle suspensions are asymmetric because of the Panhard Rod
or the Watts link.  Pittman Arm or Draglink steering systems are also
usually asymmetric.

If you attempt to read an asymmetric suspension file without selecting the
Asymmetric option, the program will ask you if you want to switch to the
Asymmetric option.  If you do NOT switch to the Asymmetric option, the
points will be converted to a symmetric case, which will probably be wrong.
