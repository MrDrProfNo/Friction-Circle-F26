                           Data Input & Control

CAD or iterate : choose between the two program modes.  CAD allows you to
                 manipulate the vehicle from the keyboard, changing ride
                 height, roll angle, steering input, and tire growth, and
                 observe the results on the screen.  Iterate calculates a
                 wide range of positions and produces tables of results.

suspension Options : You may tailor the program to your needs by choosing
                     just the options you want.  If you are doing a rear
                     suspension, you may be very interested in halfshaft
                     plunge.  If you are doing a front suspension, you
                     may not be interested.  You can also change some
                     attachment points; you can attach the swaybar drop-
                     link to the upper A-arm while the spring is attached
                     to the lower A-arm or a bell-crank pivot.

Edit data : Enter and edit the suspension points as well as the description
            of the data and even the origin of your co-ordinate system.
            This includes a graphical input and verification capability.

                           Data Input & Control

Sketch vehicle : This option allows you to look at the vehicle you have
                 specified and see if all the points are in the proper
                 places.  You can look at the vehicle from any elevation.
                 The top view may help to identify the proper location
                 of the swaybar and the steering tierod.

eXecute or quit : This sub-menu allows you to leave the Data Input and
                  Control section of the program and begin processing.
                  You may also Quit the program or start over with the
                  program options menu.  Other choices include Reading
                  another data file or Saving a file.  However, data
                  files are automatically saved when you go to the
                  processing portion of the program.
