                              Sketch vehicle

                     +-----------------------------+
                     |  F -  Full-Featured sketch  |
                     |  P -  Suspension Only       |
                     |  A -  Auxiliary Only        |
                     |  R -  Remove features       |
                     |  V -  Vehicle parameters    |
                     |  S - <Sketch Suspension   > |
                     +-----------------------------+

You may sketch the suspension to verify your data input.  Looking at a
drawing of the suspension is often more meaningful than staring at X-Y-Z
co-ordinates.  The S or <Sketch Suspension> choice will produce the
drawing.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
The other choices define the sketch.  You may draw both suspension and
auxiliary points or either.  The <Suspension Only> choice often makes
the A-arms clearer because the springs and swaybar are not shown.

The R or <Remove Features> choice is a toggle switch of whether or not
to strip the full-featured sketch and reveal the stick-model underlying
the sketch.  This option also labels the points.  If you turn this
option off, the sketch will be produced faster.
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Vehicle parameters:   You may view the suspension from behind (an
                      elevation angle of 0.0) through any position
                      to straight above (elevation angle of 90.0).
                      Changing the elevation angle will often make
                      the sketch more realistic.

                      You may also change the tire aspect ratio.

                      You may also choose to draw a sedan rather than
                      a formula car.  The sedan may be either left
                      hand drive or right hand drive.  The position
                      of the driver is an important visual clue to the
                      viewing perspective, which is from the rear.
