                              BODY ROLL

BODY ROLL is measured in degrees.  The amount of body roll is shown
under the word ROLL.  The amount and direction of body roll is depicted
graphically by a vertical bar above the chassis.  The angle of this line
is exaggerated by a factor of twenty.  Two degrees of body roll, which
is a considerable amount for a race car, is shown as forty degrees.

Positive body roll represents the chassis rolling to the right as it
would in a left hand turn.  Negative body roll is to the left, as in
a right hand turn.

The chassis is assumed to roll about a point at ground level on the
centerline of the vehicle.  This assumption provides consistency and
simplicity but contradicts the idea that the chassis rolls about the
roll center.  But there is a difference between kinematics and
mechanics.  The roll center is a conceptual point determined by
mechanics.  Some forces, such as jacking forces, are assumed to act
through the roll center.  The moment arm which determines body roll
is related to the roll center.  But the actual location of the vehicle
in a turn is the result of many forces.  For proper analysis one must
know the actual ride height and inclination of the vehicle on the track.
