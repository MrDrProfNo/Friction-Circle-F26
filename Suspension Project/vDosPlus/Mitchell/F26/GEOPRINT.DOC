The <Print> option will permit you to produce hardcopy results of
the input and the results of the computations.  With the No print
option, there will be no printed output.

You may use the PrtSc or PrintScreen function of your computer to
copy the contents of the screen to the printer regardless of
whether you select Print or No-Print in this option.

To use PrtSc with screen graphics (instead of screen text) you
must have invoked the GRAPHICS command before running the
FreeBody suspension geometry program.  See your DOS manual for
details of this command and for the types of printers it will
work with.  It may not work with laser printers.
