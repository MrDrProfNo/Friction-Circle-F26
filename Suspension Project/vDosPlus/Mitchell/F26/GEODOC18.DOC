                                SHOCK TRAVEL

     Shock Travel is the distance the shock or spring expands or compresses
in reaction to suspension movement.  Shock Travel is defined to be zero at
Ride=0.0 and Roll=0.0.  A positive value indicates the shock/spring unit
is getting longer; a negative value indicates compression.  For a simple
coilover spring/shock set-up, bump is upward movement of the wheel or
downward movement of the vehicle (negative value of Ride) and will cause
compression of the spring/shock. This will result in a negative value for
Shock Travel.  Droop (positive value of Ride) represents expansion of the
spring/shock unit and a positive value of Shock Travel.

     The program will handle a variety of rocker arm arrangements (rocker
arm, push rod, pull rod).  But for some arrangements the relationship
between Ride height and Shock Travel may be reversed.  Bump may cause
expansion and a positive value of Shock Travel.  The simplest example of
this would be a coilover shock mounted near the bottom of the vehicle and
attached to the upper A-arm.
