You can save the current suspension points in the same file you
created earlier, thereby overwriting and destroying the original
contents of that file, or you can save the current suspension
points in a new file.  If you wish to change the file name,
respond with a YES to this question.

If you do want to change the file name, the program will ask for
that file name.  Enter any valid filename, i.e. A:NEWPOINT
You do not need to add the extension; the program will add the
extension .GEO
