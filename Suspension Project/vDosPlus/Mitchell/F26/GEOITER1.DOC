                          +--------------------+
                          |  1 - <Ride Height> |
                          |  2 -  Roll Angle   |
                          |  3 -  Steer Angle  |
                          |  4 -  Tire Growth  |
                          +--------------------+

Select the first iteration variable, usually Ride Height.  Selecting
Ride Height will allow you to do a Full Ride and Roll computation, or
simply a Ride Height computation.  This will produce tables showing
the suspension parameters at different ride heights.
