The plot scale factor is currently  1.00
A larger factor will show a wider view but in smaller scale.
A smaller factor will show a larger scale but the view will be smaller.
Enter new plot scale factor:


- - - - - - - - - - - - - -  CHANGE GRAPHIC SCALE  - - - - - - - - - - - -

This function allows the user to change the graphic scale.  Most graphic
exhibits are properly scaled, but occasionally the user may wish to
adjust the scale.

If you think of the normal graphic view as a normal 55mm lens for a 35mm
cameran then a larger factor of 2.0 would correspond to a 27mm wide angle.
A plot scale factor of 0.50 would correspond to a 110 mm telephoto lens,
with a narrower field of view but greater detail of the subject.
