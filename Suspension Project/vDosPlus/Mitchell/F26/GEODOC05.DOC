                                CAMBER

Camber is the inclination of the tires from vertical, as viewed from
the front of the tire.  Camber is measured relative to the ground,
not relative to the chassis.  Camber is also measured in the plane of
the tire, meaning steering inputs are taken into account.  Zero camber
represents a perfectly vertical tire, which is considered optimum for
acceleration and braking.  Positive camber means the top of the tire
is leaning away from the chassis.  Negative camber means the top of
the tire is leaning toward the chassis.

When the vehicle encounters bumps with both wheels (the ride height goes
negative), both tires usually go toward negative camber.  The top of
both the loaded and unloaded tires go toward the chassis.  This is
negative camber on both tires, even though one leans left and the other
right.

When the body rolls the loaded tire usually develops positive camber and
the unloaded tire goes negative.  Both lean right (usually).  Choosing
the optimum camber compromise is the true art of the designer.
