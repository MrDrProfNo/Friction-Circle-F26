                               NET STEER

Net Steer is the difference between Loaded and Unloaded Steer.
A positive Net Steer represents the right or loaded wheel turning left
more than the left or unloaded wheel.  Proper Ackerman values, wherein
the outboard wheel turns less than the inboard wheel, requires TOE-OUT
or negative Net Steer.  Computing actual Ackerman steering effects
requires knowledge of the radius of the turn.
