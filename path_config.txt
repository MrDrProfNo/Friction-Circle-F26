# Commented (beginning with a #) and empty lines will be ignored. Any uncommented
# line will be treated as a path to the location specified in the comment on the
# preceding line(s). All paths must be present, with their path label preceding
# them on the same line
#
# In the event that a path instead of a filename is required, start with the
# top directory of the program, not including the top directory itself.
# For example, the path to Friction_Circle.py would be:
# "Friction_Circle.py"
# while the path to the initial calculations dump file might be
# "Friction_Circle_F26_Output/dump.xlsx".
# In the current iteration, only the VDosPlus exeutable path requires this. Other
# paths are generated by concatenating names given here


# Output Folder: The name of the folder which contains all output Excel
# files. If it does not exist, it will be created
output_folder=./Friction_Circle_F26_Output/

# Car config file: the file containing car configuration information. This file
# must exist, or the program will not execute.
car_config_path=car_config.txt

# Input excel file. Replaces the program's calculations of the input forces
# with data from an excel spreadsheet. If this field is left empty, it will be
# ignored. If the file cannot be found, the program will offer to run the
# calculations itself.
excel_input_path=./Contact_Patch_Forces.xlsx

# Dump excel filename (goes in Output Folder from above)
dump_excel_path=dump.xlsx

# Formatted excel output filename (goes in Output Folder from above)
format_excel_path=formatting.xlsx

# Parsed excel output filename (goes in Output Folder from above)
parsed_excel_path=Parsed_Forces.xlsx

# Mitchell clipboard dump, Front: intermediate file in process, you shouldn't
# really need to touch it
temp_front=tmpF.txt

# Mitchell clipboard dump, Rear: The same
temp_rear=tmpR.txt

# Parsed output, Front: Similar intermediate file, again shouldn't need to touch it
front_parsed=FOutput.txt

# Parsed output, Rear: The same
rear_parsed=ROutput.txt

# VDosPlus path: The filepath to the VDosPlus executable, which the program
# will start up for you during runtime
VDosPlus_path=./Suspension Project/vDosPlus/vDosPlus.exe

# Keypress sequence to get to the front axle run configuration in Mitchell's
# Enter as a series of arrow keys, which would be used to
# select the desired run configuration during normal use. So, for example, the
# instructions:
# 	down,down,right
# would select the run configuration that was in the second column from the left,
# third row from the top.
#
# Spaces can be used, but commas must be the separator
# If left blank, the first configuration will be selected.
front_axle_instructions=down,down,down,down,right


# Keypress sequence to get to the rear axle run configuration in Mitchell's.
# Same instructions as the front_axle_instructions field.
rear_axle_instructions=down,down,down,down,right,down
