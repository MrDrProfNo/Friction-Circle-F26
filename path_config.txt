# Commented (beginning with a #) and empty lines will be ignored. Any uncommented
# line will be treated as a path to the location specified in the comment on the
# preceding line(s). All paths must be present.

# Paths should be given relative to the current top directory of the program,
# with the top directory being represented by "./"; for example, the path to
# Friction_Circle.py would be "./Friction_Circle.py", while the path to
# the initial calculations dump file might be
# "./Friction_Circle_F26_Output/dump.xlsx"
#
# Output Folder Path: The path to the folder which contains all output Excel
# files. If it does not exist, it will be created
./Friction_Circle_F26_Output

# Car config file: the file containing car configuration information. This file
# must exist, or the program will not execute.
./car_config.txt

# Dump excel filename (goes in Output Folder from above)
./dump.xlsx

# Formatted excel output filename (goes in Output Folder from above)

# Parsed excel output filename (goes in Output Folder from above)

# Mitchell clipboard dump, Front: intermediate file in process, you shouldn't
# really need to touch it

# Parsed output, Front: Similar intermediate file, again shouldn't need to touch it
./FOutput.txt

# Parsed output, Rear: The same
